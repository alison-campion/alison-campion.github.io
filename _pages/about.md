I am a second year PhD student in Economics and Public Policy at Tufts University. Broadly, I am interested in development and urban economics, with a focus on rural-urban migration. 

Before starting grad school, I was a Research Associate at [Development Data Lab](https://www.devdatalab.org/) where I worked with large administrative datasets in India as published on the [SHRUG](https://www.devdatalab.org/shrug) platform. While there, I also worked with a project management team to guide the development of the National Data and Analytics Platform, [NDAP](https://ndap.niti.gov.in), a site that harmonizes administrative datasets across time and space to ensure public data is truly publicly accessible.
